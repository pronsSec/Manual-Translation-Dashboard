### Manual Translation Dashboard for Hugging Face Accelerated Inference API
by Been 

--- 

This dashboard conducts small paragraph translations for multiple languages. More will be added as time goes on. Currently the focus will be English to and from Russian, Balkan, other Eastern European languages.    

This model avoids the awkwardness of Google Translate, and has the best Romanian translation that I have found.

### To avoid Google entirely this entire notebook can be downloaded as .ipynb and run locally using Jupyter.

This makes use of the very powerful Hugging Face Accelerated Inference API. You will only need to update your own API key after paying for the 9/month tier. Update your key in the first cell.
