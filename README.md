Manual Translation Dashboard for Hugging Face Accelerated Inference API

-------------


This dashboard conducts small paragraph translations for multiple languages. More will be added as time goes on. Currently the focus will be English to and from Russian, Balkan, and other Eastern European languages.    

This option avoids the awkwardness of Google Translate, and has the best Romanian translation that I have found.   

 

To avoid Google entirely this entire notebook can be downloaded as .ipynb and run locally using Jupyter.  



This makes use of the very powerful Hugging Face Accelerated Inference API. You will only need to update your own API key after paying for the 9/month tier. Update your key in the first cell.   

To sign up:

If it says "----- is currently loading', 'estimated_time': --" just wait the amount of time and try again. 

------

To use this notebook just go to the Manual_Translation_Dashboard.ipynb file in this repo. Then you need to click the "Open in Colab" button if you would like to use Google Colab. If you have opsec concerns you can take the ipynb code and run it locally using Jupyter as previously stated.
